## Game Programmer - Stormhaven Studios
**:(fa-regular fa-calendar): May 2020 to Present**
### Summary
Stormhaven is an independent game development studio whose debut title, [Embers Adrift :(fa-solid fa-globe):](https://embersadrift.com) [:(fa-brands fa-steam):](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3336530/Embers_Adrift/) released in 2022 (and on Steam in 2025). Embers Adrift is an MMORPG made in Unity.
### Crafting System
Implemented and maintained our crafting system, a relatively complex solution allowing flexible use of materials per recipe and allowing those materials to ultimately affect the end stats of an item that may be several crafting steps removed. I worked extensively with one of our designers to add features and capabilities throughout development.
### Quest System
Designed and built out quest system and associated UI, integrating inky for writer-provided dialogue, allowing branching, NPC knowledge flags, alternate starts, multiple endings, a variety of possible rewards, a ridiculous number of possible objective types, and not once has a quest bug resulted in lost player progression or reward (83 quests and counting).
### Social Features
Responsible for our social service&mdash;which handles chat, groups, raids, LFG/LFM, friends, guilds, block lists, invites, mail, and cross-zone player status&mdash;as well as all the associated UIs. This service was implemented in C# using modern .NET, hosted on a Linux machine within a Docker container and utilizing the TPL to perform most action asynchronously.
